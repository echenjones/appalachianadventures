            <p style="text-align: center">
                Planning your next hike on the Appalachian Trail? Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced hiker, having the right gear can make 
                or break your adventure. Here are some essential items to pack for a safe and enjoyable hike.
            </p>

            <h2>Proper Footwear</h2>
            <h3>Hiking Boots</h3>
            <p>
                Investing in quality hiking boots is crucial. Look for boots that offer ankle support, waterproofing, and good traction. Your feet 
                will thank you on rough and muddy trails!
            </p>

            <h2>Backpack and Hydration</h2>
            <h3>Hiking Backpack</h3>
            <p>
                Choose a backpack that fits comfortably and has enough capacity for all your essentials. Make sure to include a hydration system or 
                water bottles, and aim to carry at least 2 liters of water on any hike.
            </p>

            <h2>Navigation Tools</h2>
            <h3>Map and Compass</h3>
            <p>
                Even if you’re familiar with the trail, it’s important to carry a map and compass. Consider using a GPS device or a navigation app 
                on your phone, but remember to have a traditional backup in case of dead batteries or no signal.
            </p>

            <h2>Weather-Appropriate Clothing</h2>
            <h3>Weather-Appropriate Clothing</h3>
            <p>
                Layering is key to staying comfortable on the trail. Start with a moisture-wicking base layer, followed by an insulating mid-layer, 
                and top it off with a waterproof jacket. Don’t forget your hat and gloves if you’re hiking in cooler weather.
            </p>

            <h2>Emergency Kit and First Aid</h2>
            <h3>First Aid Kit</h3>
            <p>
                Always pack a small emergency kit with essential items like a first-aid kit, whistle, multi-tool, and matches. It’s better to be 
                prepared for any situation that might arise.
            </p>

            <h2>Nutrition and Snacks</h2>
            <h3>Trail Snacks</h3>
            <p>Pack enough snacks to keep your energy up throughout the hike. High-protein snacks like nuts, trail mix, energy bars, and dried fruits 
                are great options. Always carry a little extra, just in case your hike takes longer than planned.
            </p>

            <h2>Sun Protection</h2>
            <h3>Sun Protection Gear</h3>
            <p>
                The Appalachian Trail offers plenty of open, sunny sections. Protect yourself with sunscreen, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunglasses to 
                avoid sunburn and fatigue.
